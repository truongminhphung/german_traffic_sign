# German Traffic Sign Classification

## Description

- In car industries, espescially in the self driving car field. We carefully consider the correct classification of traffic sign in the road to direct autonomous car without errors.
- With this idea in my mind. I decided to built a classifcation model using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
- This model was completely trained on GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark Dataset.
